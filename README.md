# My Awesome Project

I watched a video on this being made and decided I could make a better working version. The one I saw being made I think (if I remember) never had a draw option.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built it originally in just functions. This is one of my first projects where I was still new to Javascript. I now have a little more experience and am in the process of converting to classes.

## Optimizations

Things I would like to add if I have time are:

- Making the deck stacks show as in offset each card a few pixels to see how high or low your pile is
- Changing the user's name color by how well they are doing. the redder it gets the worse you are, same with green maybe
- Adding some animation to the cards being flipped

## Lessons Learned:

I am learning how to append and remove images from the DOM.

## Basic Game Play

This is a simple card game where Ace is high and you just lay out a card. High card wins and the winner keeps their card and takes the opponent's card. If there is a draw then you lay two more cards out face down and the third card face up. If a draw again continue until there is a winner. High card takes all the cards that were laid out. You play until you or your opponent has all the cards.
